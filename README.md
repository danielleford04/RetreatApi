## Uploading files with React.js and Node.js

This repo is for my blog [Uploading files with React.js and Node.js](https://medium.com/ecmastack/uploading-files-with-react-js-and-node-js-e7e6b707f4ef). Many people found my code examples to be confusing, so I created this repo to demo how everything comes together.

I didn't add redux in this one, but if you want it - [let me know](https://twitter.com/netxm).

Example with Next.js to simplify the setup. Same can be applied to any React+Node app.
